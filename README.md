# Data Structures in JavaScript

In this repo I work on [Egghead's Data Structure in JS course](https://egghead.io/lessons/javascript-queue-data-structure-in-javascript).

The course itself involves no automated tests. I am implementing everything with TDD so that, well, things are tested, and operations to all data structures are documented as code.

### Install

`yarn install`

### Run

`yarn test`
